**This C++ code snippet efficiently sorts a vector of integers using the std::sort algorithm from the <algorithm> library. It begins by including necessary headers for input/output, vector manipulation, and sorting functionalities. A vector named numbers is then initialized with unsorted integer values. The core functionality lies in the std::sort call, which arranges the vector's elements in ascending order using iterators to define the sorting range. Finally, a loop iterates through the now-sorted vector, printing each element to the console. This simple yet powerful example is highly useful in various scenarios, including data organization for efficient searching and retrieval, data analysis tasks requiring ordered data, database operations, algorithm implementations, and enhancing user interfaces by displaying information in a structured manner. Sorting is a fundamental operation that optimizes data processing and is frequently employed in competitive programming and general softwareÂ development.**
